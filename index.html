      Hi there! My name is Reagan, and welcome to my personal website. I’m a student at Northeastern University studying Computer Science and Media Arts, where I get to combine my love for technology and creativity. Over the past few years, I’ve explored both traditional art and digital media, and I’ve recently fallen in love with video production — editing, storytelling, and visual experimentation.  
      <br><br>
      Beyond academics, I’m part of KADA, a dance organization that celebrates performance and self-expression, and I also mentor younger artists through the Digital Illustration Association. My goal is to use creative media to spread joy and inspire new perspectives, blending technical skill with a personal, emotional voice.  
      <br><br>
      This website is a small space to share who I am, what I create, and what inspires me — I hope you enjoy exploring it!
